## 📄 About Me

I recently completed my PhD at the University of Sheffield, where I focused on developing trustworthy deep learning models for medical and clinical applications. My work integrates deep neural networks, wavelet-based representations, and adversarial detection mechanisms to improve robustness and interpretability in real-world settings.

I have published four peer-reviewed papers, including journal and conference venues (IEEE ACCESS, ICASSP, BMVC), with one currently under review at IEEE TNNLS. I am also experienced in cross-disciplinary collaboration, student supervision, and academic writing.

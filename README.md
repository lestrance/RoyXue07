## 📄 About Me

I recently completed my PhD in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Sheffield. My research focused on developing robust and interpretable deep learning models for real-world medical image analysis, with an emphasis on adversarial example detection, uncertainty-aware decision-making, and feature-level robustness under distribution shift.

In my thesis, I proposed a set of quantisation, regularisation, and knowledge transfer methods using wavelet scattering features to enhance the adversarial resilience of deep neural networks. I also developed a novel region-of-interest aware 3D ResNet architecture for prognostic classification of volumetric chest CT scans during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I have published four peer-reviewed papers (IEEE ICASSP, IEEE ACCESS, BMVC, and one under review at IEEE TNNLS), with over 70 citations to date. I have experience working with interdisciplinary teams across engineering, clinical medicine, and computer science, and have contributed to project supervision and collaborative research development.

## 🏆 Key Projects

### 1. 🫁 Covid-19 Diagnosis with 3D Transfer Learning [[PDF]](./Covid-19_Diagnostic_Using_3d_Deep_Transfer_Learning_for_Classification_of_Volumetric_Computerised_Tomography_Chest_Scans.pdf)

We developed a 3D deep transfer learning pipeline for classifying COVID-19 infections from volumetric CT scans. Using pretrained 3D ResNet architectures, the system achieved high classification performance with minimal training data, demonstrating potential for real-world clinical triage support during the pandemic.

**Tech stack:** PyTorch, MONAI, 3D ResNet, Medical image pre-processing  
**Published in:** IEEE ICASSP 2021

### 2. 🧠 ROI-Aware 3D ResNet for Chest CT Classification [[PDF]](./Region-of-Interest_Aware_3D_ResNet_for_Classification_of_COVID-19_Chest_Computerised_Tomography_Scans.pdf)

This work proposes an ROI-aware feature enhancement block integrated into a 3D ResNet, focusing on regions affected by lung infection. The model outperforms conventional 3D ResNets in COVID-19 CT classification by improving sensitivity to disease-relevant areas.

**Tech stack:** PyTorch, SimpleITK, lung segmentation, attention-based pooling  
**Published in:** IEEE ACCESS (2023)

---

### 3. 🛡️ Adversarial Awareness with Hand-crafted Features *(Appears later this year at the conference)*

This paper validates the inherent robustness of hand-crafted features (especially WSN) under adversarial attacks and proposes:
- **Adversarial Awareness Score (AAS):** A feature-discrepancy metric to detect adversarial examples.
- **AAS-Guided Jacobian Regularisation:** A novel training strategy enhancing robustness without sacrificing clean accuracy.

**Tech stack:** MATLAB, PyTorch, ImageNet experiments, adversarial attacks
**Published in:** [BMVC 2025](https://bmvc2025.bmva.org/)

---

### 4. 🔄 Feature Projection Network for Robust Classification *(Currently Submitted for Review)*

We present a neural projection method that maps WSN features to DNN feature space, enabling robust classification from adversarially stable representations. The technique enhances robustness by transforming input features before classification, without modifying the DNN architecture.

**Tech stack:** PyTorch, Autoencoders, Seq2Seq regression, Wavelet Scattering Network  
**Status:** Under review at IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)
